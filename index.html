      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in psychology in 2022. My interest in coding began when I took some courses on coding with Python during college. Coding was not always a breeze, and I learned to lean on others as well as the course resources. I enjoy collaborating with others to work on problems and come up with solutions.</p>
      <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy playing and watching sports like soccer and basketball. I also love to cook.</p>
